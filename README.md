The paper is available in 

## Installation
EQGraphNet is based on [Pytorch](https://pytorch.org/docs/stable/index.html) and [Pytorch Geometric](https://pytorch-geometric.readthedocs.io/en/latest/index.html)<br>
Firstly please create a virtual environment for yourself<br>
`conda create -n your-env-name python=3.9`<br><br>
Then, there are some Python packages need to be installed<br>
